# Garden-Defense

Contains various defenders and attackers type. Defenders can be bought in exchange for stars which are generated by killing enemies and placing a trophy-type defender in the game. Click on the desired place in the game grid to place a defender. 

Both defenders and attackers have limited health. Remaining health is represented by a health bar under each character.
