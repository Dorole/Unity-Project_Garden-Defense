Contains various defenders and attackers type. Defenders can be bought in exchange for stars which are generated by killing enemies and placing a trophy-type defender in the game. Click on the desired place in the game grid to place a defender. 

Both defenders and attackers have limited health. Remaining health is represented by a health bar under each character. 

Prevent attackers from entering the garden before the timer runs out, but beware: not all defenses are effective against all attacker types. 

The game gradually introduces you to new defender and attacker types. Each level requires a different strategy to win. 

List of defenders: 
Cactus (low cost, shoots off mushrooms), Trophy (low cost, generates stars, can't deal damage), Tombstone (medium cost, stops lizards until destroyed, can't deal damage), Gnome (medium cost, shoots off axes, deals higher damage), Scarecrow (high cost, can't deal damage, scares off lizards and foxes).

List of attackers: 
Lizard (slow, medium health, has to destroy any defender in its way before moving on), Fox (fast, low health, can jump over tombstones), Ghastly (medium speed, can pass through anything, can only be killed by cacti), Golem (slow, high health, deals a lot of damage, can destroy scarecrows).
